                <h4 class="space-stack-xs">Accessibility considerations</h4>
                <p class="space-stack-s">Always ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors. Our color
                    palette has been designed with accessibility in mind, but always verify contrast ratios when
                    creating
                    new combinations.</p>
                <p class="space-stack-s">For text on colored backgrounds, use white text on dark colors and dark text on
                    light colors to
                    maintain
                    a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.</p>

                <p>Accent colors used as a part of layout contrast should ideally be accompanied by other elements
                    (borders, underlines, etc.) to show separation - more so if the saturation difference between the
                    accent color and the background color is low. If solid borders are too heavy, feel free to
                    experiment with dashed and dotted borders sparingly.</p>

                <h4 class="space-stack-xs">Using the fluid type scale</h4>
                <p class="space-stack-xs">Our typography system uses CSS custom properties for consistent sizing:</p>
                <pre class="code-example">
/* Headings */
h1 { font-size: var(--step-5); }
h2 { font-size: var(--step-4); }
h3 { font-size: var(--step-3); }

/* Text sizes */
.text-xs { font-size: var(--step--2); }
.text-s { font-size: var(--step--1); }
.text-m { font-size: var(--step-0); }
.text-l { font-size: var(--step-1); }</pre>
                <p class="space-stack-s">The fluid scale ensures text sizes adapt smoothly between viewport sizes.</p>
                <p class="space-stack-xs"><strong>Note:</strong> Our fluid typography scale uses the golden ratio
                    (1.618) to
                    create a harmonious progression that matches our spacing system. Each step is approximately 1.618
                    times
                    larger than the previous step, creating a natural, organic feel that aligns with our brand values.
                </p>
                <p>This approach ensures our typography remains proportional and harmonious across all device sizes
                    without
                    requiring breakpoints, while maintaining the same mathematical relationship found in nature that we
                    use

  &lt;div&gt;Auto-sizing column&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;Column 2&lt;/div&gt;
